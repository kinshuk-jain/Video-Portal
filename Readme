-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- General Info -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-1- The Code has been written in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and JQuery

-2- The code is well documented. Attempt has been made so that no one with a coding background 
    finds it difficult to understand. 
   
-3- The CSS and Javascript files have not been optimized for space to leave comments, whitespaces
    and tabs. Function names and variables are self-explanatory. This will result in slower load times.

-4- It shows a login popup if the user has not logged in. There is no way for the user to 
    go around this popup and access our app, thereby fulfilling FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT #3.

-5- The popup has color coded indications to guide the user to enter valid credentials

-6- The popup also provides for a future implementation of user sign up. It has
    not been implemented as of now as it was not required. 
    
-7- When in expanded video mode, i.e., on video page, lazy loading has been disabled to keep page length
    in control and to not go too deep into the scroll pane should we enable it. To enable lazy
    loading in video mode, comment out line number 236 in vidRender.js and line number 18 in main.js. 
    Uncomment line number 21-25 in main.js. 


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- How to Run -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

*** Setup ***
-1- To setup the application, download the repository and change your directory to its path.  
    Create a folder named client and copy the following in that folder -
    - CryptoJS folder
    - JS folder
    - css folder
    - images folder
    - index.html
    
-2- Start the backend NodeJS server on port 3000. To do so, simply change to the directory where you downloaded the repository in step 1. 
    Type the following command without quotes - "npm start"

-3- Start MongoDB on port 27017

*** Run ***
-4- To run the application simply run the index.html in the client folder in any 
    javascript enabled browser that supports HTML5 and CSS3. Earlier browser versions will 
    not show CSS3 animations. 
   
-5- You can also open the following URL to run the application - http://localhost:3000/index.html


-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- Running Unit Tests -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-1- The unit tests are contained under the "unit_tests" folder.
    If step 1, 2 and 3 under the "How to Run" section above were performed, then open "unit_tests" folder and copy its contents
    in the client folder created in step 1 of "how to run".
-2- Then simply open the broswer console and type the following url - "http://localhost:3000/unit_testing_index.html" to run unit tests. 
     
-3- The unit tests make use of setTimeout function of javascript to get around asynchronous nature of ajax calls. 
    Please wait for 20 seconds at least to let the tests complete. 
    
-4- To see full logs, please enable persistent logging on the web console so that it is not refreshed on page reload/
    navigation
