-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- General Info -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

-1- The Code has been written in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and JQuery

-2- The code is well documented. Attempt has been made so that no one with a coding background 
    should not finds it difficult to understand. 
   
-3- The CSS and Javascript files have not been optimized for space to leave comments, whitespaces
    and tabs. Function names and variables are self-explanatory. This will result in slower load times.

-4- It shows a login popup if the user has not logged in. There is no way for the user to 
    go around this popup and access our app, thereby fulfilling FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT #3.

-5- The popup has color coded indications to guide the user to enter valid credentials

-6- The popup also provides for a future implementation of user sign up. It has
    not been implemented as of now as it was not required. 
    
-7- When in expanded video mode, i.e., on video page, lazy loading has been disabled to keep page length
    in control and to not go too deep into the scroll pane should we enable it. To enable lazy
    loading in video mode, comment out line number 236 in vidRender.js and line number 18 in main.js. Uncomment
    line number 21-25 in main.js.
